 task planning and motion planning that has the following
 key properties: It is aggressively hierarchical; it makes
 choices and commits to them in a top-down fashion in an
 attempt to limit the length of plans that need to be
 constructed, and thereby exponentially decrease the amount
 of search required. It operates on detailed, continuous
 geometric representations and does not require a-priori
 discretization of the state or action spaces.},
