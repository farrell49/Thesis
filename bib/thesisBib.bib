	abstract = {A new design of a two-stage cycloidal speed reducer is presented in this paper. A traditional two-stage cycloidal speed reducer is obtained by the simple combination of single-stage cycloidal speed reducers. A single-stage reducer engages two identical cycloid discs in order to balance dynamical loads and to obtain uniform load distribution. Consequently, the traditional two-stage reducer has four cycloid discs, in total. The newly designed two-stage cycloidal speed reducer, presented in this paper, has one cycloid disc for each stage, that is, two cycloid discs in total, which means that it is rather compact. Due to its specific concept, this reducer is characterized by good load distribution and dynamic balance, and this is described in the paper. Stress state analysis of cycloidal speed reducer elements was also realized, using the finite elements method ({FEM}), for the most critical cases of conjugate gear action (one, two, or three pairs of teeth in contact). The results showed that cycloid discs are rather uniformly loaded, justifying the design solution presented here. Experimental analysis of the stress state for cycloid discs was realized, using the strain gauges method. It is easy to conclude, based on the obtained results, that even for the most critical case (one pair of teeth in contact) stresses on cycloid discs are in the allowed limits, thus providing normal functioning of the reducer for its anticipated lifetime.},

This paper presents the design of a new two-stage cycloidal speed reducer with tooth modifications. The topological structure of cycloidal drives is discussed and analyzed with the aid of graphs. New cycloidal gear reducers are enumerated through the topological analysis and a new two-stage cycloidal gear reducer with simpler structure is then proposed. The design of the proposed cycloidal gear reducer is also performed, including profile generation and modifications. Subsequently, kinematic errors are analyzed by using the tooth contact analysis, and the results caused by different combinations of the gear profile modifications are presented quantitatively. Finally, based on the analysis, a mock-up of the cycloidal gear drive is constructed to validate the feasibility of the new mechanism.},

	abstract = {The design of cycloid speed reducer has to satisfy various constraints, e.g. the geometrical, the kinematical and the mechanical, while delivering excellent performance, high efficiency, long life, great load capacity, etc. This invokes the need of an optimal design methodology to achieve these objectives collectively. Taking K-H-V cycloid speed reducers as the research subject, an optimization methodology based on genetic algorithm is presented. The goal of the optimization is to simultaneously minimize volume and maximize efficiency. The volume and the efficiency of the reducer are simultaneously taken as objective functions. The design variables including the short width coefficient, the diameter of the pin, the width of the cycloid gear, etc. are defined. The constraint conditions are established for multi-optimizations. In order to elaborate the proposed optimization methodology, the {XW}3-type cycloid speed reducer is chosen and utilized as an example for optimization. A comparison study on the single optimization is also carried out in this work. The research results are satisfactory and can help designers to employ for minimum material and cost by fulfilling high efficiency and other performance requirements.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates different transmission methods for a two-stage speed reducer by analyzing component motion and stress conditions during reducer operation. First, an exemplar (set) speed-reducing ratio is used to develop four differently structured two-stage speed reducers: a traditional design using two serially connected single-stage speed reducers, an Rotate Vector (RV) reducer constructed by serially connecting a cycloid speed reducer and an involute planet gear reducer, and two new concept designs. The first new concept named “New design 1” has a pin component in which a cam pair and pins connect two-stage cycloidal gears having different tooth numbers. The second new concept named “New design 2” has a center disc component in which a cam pair symmetrically connects two-stage cycloid gears with different tooth numbers. These four structural types of two-stage speed reducer form the basis for a system dynamics analysis model used to analyze the main components’ motion and stress variation conditions. Besides, this study also carries out the cycloid internal gear (nonpinwheel design) to replace the pinwheel in these four-structured two-stage speed reducers. The results highlight the differences and shortcomings of the four transmissions with pinwheel and nonpinwheel designs, including the dynamic load imbalance and stress peaks phenomena caused by design inadequacies.},
