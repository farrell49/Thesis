Increasingly, complex robotic mobile manipulators are applied to solve problems in unstructured environments, such as in disaster relief or spacecraft logistics.
How to design a software system to command these robots, select and design the component modules, and integrate each piece is an open question due to the multi-modal nature and complicated requirements of such systems, especially for robots with many degrees of freedom and multiple end-effectors.
This paper presents one approach, a system composed of three layers on top of a robotic system: a user interface, object handling, and task and motion planning.
The software system was developed for NASA / GM's Robonaut 2 (R2), a complex humanoid mobile manipulator intended for use in microgravity environments, and has enabled R2 to accomplish sequences of tasks with complex constraints all through one system. 
We also present the system as applied to a archetypal problem and discuss the primary takeaways gathered from experience.
